 I recently completed a simple yet innovative car prototype utilizing ATmega16 Microcontrollers running at 16MHz. This project incorporates a variety of drivers including 2 DC-motors, 3 LEDs, and 5 buttons, resulting in a dynamic and interactive design.

Here's a quick overview of its functionality:

🔘 Pressing a specific button initiates forward movement of the car.
🔘 Another button triggers backward motion.
🔘 Turning right or left is achieved with dedicated buttons.
🔘 A separate button is designated for stopping the car.

Additionally, the prototype includes visual indicators for enhanced user experience:

⚠️ When the car turns right or left, a yellow LED blinks momentarily.
⚠️ Similarly, a blinking yellow LED indicates left turns.
🛑 When the car comes to a stop, a red LED illuminates briefly.
